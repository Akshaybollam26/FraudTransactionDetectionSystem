# Fraud Transaction Detection System

## Parkinson's Disease Classification:

This repository contains machine learning models for classifying a transaction is fraud transaction or not. Models included are  Logistic Regrssion, Random Forest Classifier, MLP Classifier and XG Boost. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature selection, model training and performance evaluation.


## Features:

    Data Preprocessing: Handling null values, One Hot Encoding, 
    Feature Selection: Selecting all the features using other than fraud column.
    Model Training: Implementations of Logistic Regrssion, Random Forest Classifier, MLP Classifier and XG Boost.
    Performance Metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix, precision, recall, and F1-score.
    

## Requirements:

    pandas
    numpy
    sklearn
    matplotlib

## Results:

  The models are evaluated using cross-validation with the following metrics:
  
    Mean Accuracy
    Mean Confusion Matrix
    Mean Precision
    Mean Recall
    Mean F1-score
    ROC - AUC Curve
